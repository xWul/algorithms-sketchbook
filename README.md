This repository serves as my personal sketchbook for exploring algorithms and data structures. While I strive for correctness in my implementations, please note that the code here is not necessarily optimized for performance, as its primary purpose is to serve as a learning tool.

I started doing some courses, below I'll provide a list of these courses along with the associated exercises.
